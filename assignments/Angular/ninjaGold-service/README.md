Making Ninja Gold with Angular Services
For this assignment utilize your knowledge of event handlers, angular components, and services.

Your AppComponent should be the parent to two other components. The AppComponent should provide building data to one of the other components. That component should use this provided data to create the building forms.

Have the “app.component.html” display the gold count and other components.

Use the second component more than once. Each building form should be it’s own variation of the second component.

The third component should display the logged data.

Remember, your service should be the main hub for data manipulation and storage.
