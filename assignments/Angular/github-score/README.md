GitHub Score
Create an app which a user may submit a GitHub username. Use the username given to retrieve the user information from the GitHub API, calculate a score based on the # of public repos and # of followers, and present the score to the user with a message based on the score.

REMINDER: When building applications which include forms and http requests, be sure to import the 'FormsModule' and 'HttpClientModule' in your AppModule file (referenced in the 'Installation & CLI' chapter).
