Binary Search Tree - remove
Objectives:
Apply your logic skills.
Technical interview practice.
Remove a node from a BST without losing any other nodes or misplacing any nodes.
Using prototype, create a method that, when given a value, will remove the node that contains that value from the BST. If the node does not exist, return false.

Remember to do this without changing the value attribute of any nodes. The only things that may be altered are the pointers.

HINT: Start simple by removing a leaf node. Then, consider if the node has one child. Finally, consider the case where the node has two children.
