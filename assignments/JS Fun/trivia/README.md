Trivia
Objectives:
Manipulate the DOM based on data received from an API.
Manipulate the DOM based on user interaction.
Use this open trivia API found here https://opentdb.com/api_config.php to build a trivia game. You may produce your own API url to provide different kinds of trivia questions. For example, https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10&type=multiple responds with ten multiple choice questions from a variety of categories. Feel free to generate a url that focuses on questions that interest you.

There is no need to include a backend or a database. Each time the user refreshes the page, have the game start again. Include at least five questions. You may design your game however you like, or you may use the wireframe provided for inspiration. 

Spend no more than four hours on this assignment. The goal is to have you practice displaying data received from an API, not to get caught up in the mechanics of a game.
